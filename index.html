		 		<h2 id="film" class="text-bleu"> ✨Hobbies✨</h2>
		 		<p>
		 			I enjoy being outside to hang out with some friends, my boyfriend or my family in Paris or close to home. I also appreciate going to the movies, listening to music or doing activities such as lazer game, bowling, museums...

				<h2 id="States" class="text-vert">Trips ✈️ 🗺️</h2> 
		 		<p>
		 			I love to travel and visit new countries. I've visited several European countries, including Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy... I particularly enjoy seeing my family in the United States and visiting different states such as Alaska, New York, Wisconsin and Illinois. I go to the Alps every year in autumn to see my family and in winter to ski. I'd love to travel to Asia one day.

				<h2 id="bad" class="text-orange">Sports 🏆</h2>
		 		<p>
		 			I grew up playing various sports: tennis for over 12 years, dance for 9 years, athletics for 7 years, climbing, snowboarding, biking... I currently play tennis and have started playing ultimate. I've also tried extreme sports like hang-gliding, via ferrata, mountain biking...

		 		<h2 id="ratatouille" class="text-marron">Food 🌮</h2>
		 		<p>
		 			I like to cook all kinds of food in general. I generally prepare dishes rather than desserts, but I still like to make pies, cakes... My favorite dish is ratatouille (French cuisine) or enchiladas (Mexican cuisine). I like to try out recipes that I discover on the Internet or in cookbooks that I own.
